# Introduction to GitHub

## What is GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It hosts Git repositories and provides tools for managing and sharing code.

## What is Git
Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes.

## Git Repository Model
A Git repository contains all of the project files and the entire revision history. It can be hosted on a remote server (like GitHub) or locally on your computer.

### Local Repository
- Located on your computer.
- Allows offline work.

### Remote Repository
- Hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- Facilitates collaboration and backup.

## Why Do We Need Git/GitHub
- **Version Control**: Keeps track of every change made to the codebase.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts.
- **Backup**: Ensures code is safely stored and can be recovered.
- **Branching**: Allows experimentation without affecting the main codebase.

## Why Do Students Need GitHub
- **Portfolio**: Showcase your projects to potential employers.
- **Collaboration**: Work on group projects more efficiently.
- **Learning**: Access and contribute to open-source projects.

## Git Actions: Submit, Push, Pull...
- **Clone**: `git clone <repository-url>` - Copies a repository to your local machine.
- **Add**: `git add <file>` - Stages changes for commit.
- **Commit**: `git commit -m "message"` - Saves changes to the local repository.
- **Push**: `git push` - Uploads changes to a remote repository.
- **Pull**: `git pull` - Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository.
- **Branch**: `git branch <branch-name>` - Creates a new branch.
- **Merge**: `git merge <branch-name>` - Combines branches.

## Git Version History and Rollback
- **Log**: `git log` - Shows the commit history.
- **Checkout**: `git checkout <commit-id>` - Switches to a specific commit.
- **Revert**: `git revert <commit-id>` - Creates a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit.
- **Reset**: `git reset --hard <commit-id>` - Resets the current branch to a specific commit.
